# Karst Hydrology Honors Project - Cleaning and Graphing Primary Source Data

### Business Objective
I was tasked to clean, organise and plot data retrieved from two HOBO data loggers; the devices submerged in water collect hydrological data such as water temperature, 
water level and water conductivity.

**<ins>I did not do the data analysis for this project<ins/>** but followed directions from the author of the paper to organise the raw data to their liking, merging the HOBO data retrievals, 
setting NaN values where there may have been corrupted data and joining weather station data from multiple weather stations.


### Project Summary
Data loggers were placed at two points in a Vancouver Island watershed to study the hydrology of a karst environment with long-term goals of understanding the effects of tree logging activities in the area, 
specfically the impacts of logging as it pertains to karstic environments.
Specific conductivity measurements were used as a karst indicator since karst waters have 5 to 10 times higher electric conductivity than non-karst waters.

### Skills
Python, pandas, matplotlib, Google sheets

### Additional Project Notes
- The data loggers are still active as of September 2025.
- I am building and reworking scripts to automate the data cleaning and storing process in case another uVic student decides to continue exploring the data.
- A tipping bucket was installed in the area to measure precipitation but due to some environmental factors (freezing), weather station data was used instead.
  The tipping bucket data was still included in the repository.
- I graphed 6 Case studies but several of them were scrapped before the actual Honors defense.
